"Small fires crackle into life on the hills around us at the slightest provocation. Creeks swell with flash floods, as upland snow melts at record speed. Our town’s beloved colony of great blue herons fall stunned out of the trees in their dozens. Animals, from cougars to rattlesnakes, leave their hidden places to seek water. The temperature has risen, and stalled, at a nearly unbearable 45C.This is what a heat dome feels like in Vernon, a community in the British Columbian interior in Canada.It’s been quite the summer in British Columbia (BC), where a brutal heatwave has given way to wildfires. At 49.6C, the village of Lytton set a hotter record than there’s ever been in Las Vegas. The fires have burned nearly 8,582 sq km of forest since the spring and caused evacuation orders to be issued across the province. Lytton and another nearby community, Monte Lake, have been destroyed by the vengeful climate.Our fire, here in Vernon, announced itself with a wave of thick smoke and a glowing red horizon that made us think of JRR Tolkien’s Mordor. At midnight, an evacuation order was issued for the west side of the Okanagan Lake, where members of the Okanagan Indian Band live among enclaves of retirees, ranchers and back-to-the-landers. Soon after, two exhausted evacuees arrived at our door with their dogs, cats and belongings; they are friends of ours, to whom we had promised refuge.As the fire grew across the lake over the next few days, we found ourselves talking with hushed voices. Unable to ignore the red glare on the horizon, we felt awestruck by the ash floating from the sky, covering our decks, outdoor tables and car windshields. We shared photos of the piles of burnt forest debris, mainly small black twigs and needles, that had washed ashore on the lake’s beaches. We spoke obsessively of the air quality index, which I estimated had reached 45 times the World Health Organization exposure recommendation, ranking it as one of the worst on the planet.Mary Stockdale’s son, pictured far right, with other firefighters near Vernon, British Columbia. Photograph: Justin RobertsonSometimes it was not ash, but still-glowing embers that floated over to our side of the lake. Although the water provided a natural barrier to the front of the fire, it was being breached by these small missiles, and all of us had to look lively for any fires that started up under these tinder-dry conditions.As the situation worsened, an evacuation alert for Vernon was announced, stirring us all into action. My husband and I started packing. What do we need to live on? What don’t we want to lose to the fire? My mother was trying to do the same next door, but she was hampered by my bewildered father who has dementia. My daughter ran over to help.Eventually, we assembled a convoy of vehicles, packed to the brim and ready to move our three-generation family, our twice-evacuated friends and our assortment of pets. We worried about what it would be like if the people of greater Vernon got the order to evacuate, and all 66,000 of us tried to move out at once.Later that day, the cultural centre across the street decided to go ahead with its live outdoor concert. Like passengers on the Titanic, we sat on our ashy front steps and listened to the music. To our delight, the first rainstorm in weeks blew in to rescue us, and we jumped up to dance in the raindrops, accompanied by the happy whoops of the musicians over the loudspeakers.As a result of the rain, the evacuation alert was rescinded, at least for most of Vernon. However, the west side remained evacuated, with dozens of homes burned to the ground. I joined many other community members in volunteering to help with the registration of several thousand evacuees and their referral to emergency services.It’s good that the BC government looks after people’s basic needs: shelter, food, clothing, incidentals, but this doesn’t alleviate their misery. These were emotionally exhausted people: an elderly woman who longed for her home and garden; a man who had put his back out with the effort of moving house; a family who, in rescuing their grandmother with her oxygen tank, were forced to jettison most of their belongings. Saddest of all was a young family who broke down telling us about the mother dog with puppies that they had to abandon to the flames when fleeing the fire.In the cadet barracks on the south side of town, 250 soldiers were brought in to help us, and a camp was set up on the north side for 330 firefighters. A small group of locals have gathered at a spot on the highway to cheer them home each evening.How can Britain be committed to net zero when it’s about to drill for millions more barrels of oil? | Greg MuttittRead moreMy son, a 21-year-old firefighter, called. Since he was new to this, we had hoped they would put him to work digging ditches, but he was sent straight to the front, where he said it was like a war zone: helicopters buzzing, smoke thick, trees suddenly candling.My brother called. A fire researcher, he’s been making predictive models from satellite imagery for the firefighters. He was feeling anxious for us, as he could see that a second heatwave was on its way, to be followed by gusting winds that might stir up our fire again.Once again, we have been thrust into a period of uncertainty. What will happen to us and to other endangered communities to the north and east of our fire?A federal election has just been called in Canada. We desperately hope our region’s voters, given all that we have gone through, will send a strong protest vote to Ottawa, saying they must take the climate crisis seriously. The land around us is burning, the air is unbreathable, people in our community have become climate refugees. This is an existential threat. If not now, when?

"The world’s largest sand island formed around a million years ago and enabled the southern and central Great Barrier Reef to develop, new research suggests.An international team of scientists have dated K’gari (Fraser Island) and the nearby Cooloola Sand Mass in south-east Queensland as forming between 0.7m and 1.2m years ago.‘Fraser Island’ to be dropped in favour of Indigenous name K’gari under Queensland proposalRead moreTheir formation was “a necessary precondition for initiation of the southern and central Great Barrier Reef”, the researchers found.In geological terms, the world’s largest reef system developed relatively recently – an estimated 450,000 to 670,000 years ago.The study’s authors described this timing as a “conundrum”, because climatic conditions along the central and southern Queensland coastline have been ideal for reef growth since much earlier – between 2.6m years and 5.3m years ago, during the Pliocene epoch.Study co-author Prof Patrick Moss, head of the school of earth and environmental sciences at the University of Queensland, said there were two main theories for the formation of the Great Barrier Reef.

The first is temperature – “that basically from around 500,000 … [to] 700,000 years ago, there was a 4C increase in sea surface temperatures which allowed reef growth to occur,” Moss said.The second theory, which the K’gari study supports, is that clear waters were necessary.“Before K’gari and the other giant sand masses were formed, you had a lot more sand transport further north, and so that would produce murkier water and limit reef growth at that time,” Moss said.K’gari, a Unesco world heritage site, is the world’s largest sand island and also the end point of one of the world’s longest “longshore drift” coastal systems. Sand from the island originates as far as central New South Wales, travelling 1,500km north along the east coast of Australia.“The longshore drift process picks up sand grains and transports them to K’gari and along the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast,” Moss said. “That’s a really important aspect of creating south-east Queensland environment.”K’gari and the dune fields acted as a barrier to this longshore drift process, enabling reef growth, the study’s authors suggest.The researchers dated the age of the dunes on K’gari using two techniques: optically stimulated luminescence and palaeomagnetic dating.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to Afternoon UpdateFree daily newsletterOur Australian afternoon update breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

"Parts of Alaska have experienced considerable snowfall this autumn, with the state’s largest city on track to surpass its November record by some margin.The city of Anchorage, which typically receives about 5 inches (12cm) of snow during the first two weeks of November, has so far had an impressive 37.9 inches. Several daily records have been broken, most starkly on 8 November, with 9 inches of snow within 24 hours. That was part of a larger three-day snowstorm that brought more than 20 inches in total. A state of emergency was declared in the city during this event, prompting the closure of schools, suspension of public transport, and increased efforts to find shelter for the homeless population, with four deaths reported among people living outdoors.With half the month still to go and another large snowfall event forecast for early next week, Anchorage’s record for November – 38.8 inches in 1994 – is expected to topple. November 2023 will end as one of Anchorage’s snowiest months of all time, with the top spot held by February 1996, which saw 52.1 inches. Anchorage typically receives about 77 inches for winter as a whole, with the all-time record of 134.5 inches set during the winter season of 2011-12.In the South Pacific, Fiji was affected by Severe Tropical Cyclone Mal this week, which passed to the south-west of the islands on Wednesday and Thursday. The cyclone was equivalent in strength to a category 1 hurricane, with gusts of almost 100mph near the centre of the storm. Fiji closed many schools, and some homes were evacuated, but despite strong winds and heavy rainfall, the storm passed by with enough distance to prevent significant damage. Mal then continued southward, weakening to an extra tropical cyclone.Another tropical cyclone is expected to develop on Friday, this time in the Bay of Bengal. At the time of writing, the tropical depression was moving northwards towards Bangladesh, and was expected to intensify into a tropical cyclone before making landfall on Friday. If the storm does reach cyclone status, it will be called Midhili, a name proposed by the Maldives. The expected cyclone is forecast to produce 50-60mph gusts, with 100-150mm of rainfall possible for south-western parts of Bangladesh.","{""Extreme snowfall in Anchorage, Alaska"": 8, ""Severe Tropical Cyclone Mal affecting Fiji"": 7, ""Potential tropical cyclone Midhili in the Bay of Bengal"": 6}"
"Good morning.Today’s newsletter comes to you from Manchester, original home of the Guardian (est 1821), and me, Helen Pidd, your friendly north of England editor. I’ll be writing the daily briefing alongside Nimo for the next few weeks.Our latest edition concerns events in Japan 12 years ago, when a huge earthquake struck off the country’s north-east coast, triggering a tsunami that caused the worst nuclear disaster since Chornobyl.More than a decade later, the clean-up continues at Fukushima. This week the Japanese government announced that work will begin on Thursday to pump more than one million tonnes of water into the sea from the destroyed Daiichi nuclear power plant, in a move that has prompted horror from environmental groups and consternation in neighbouring countries.Is it madness to pollute the Pacific Ocean with enough tainted water to fill at least 500 Olympic-sized swimming pools?I spoke to the Guardian’s Japan correspondent, Justin McCurry, as he packed his bags to return to Fukushima, saying that he had no qualms about drinking the local sake and how the area has become a surfing hotspot once more.In depth: ‘Plants pump diluted tritium into the sea all the time and nobody bats an eyelid’An activist holds a placard at a protest in Seoul against the planned release of wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear plant into the Pacific Ocean. 22 August 2023. Photograph: Anthony Wallace/AFP/Getty ImagesOn 11 March 2011 a magnitude 9.0 earthquake triggered a tsunami that knocked out the backup electricity supply at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant on Japan’s north-eastern Pacific coast, leading to meltdowns in three of its reactors.Ever since, 1.34m tonnes of radioactive water has accumulated at the site, according to the plant operator, Tokyo Electric Power Company (Tepco). This includes liquid used for cooling, plus rain and groundwater that has seeped in.Earlier this year, Justin visited the site, and saw the thousand or so steel tanks being used to house the contaminated water (pictured above). “They’re three storeys high and are all together across a wide area,” he said.Tepco says it will soon run out of storage room and this week was granted permission to start releasing “treated” water from the tanks into the Pacific Ocean.The plan has caused controversy because the water contains tritium, a radioactive form of hydrogen that can’t be removed by the facility’s water filtration technology.It will not be pumped out all at once, but over the next 30 to 40 years. The first discharge, starting on Thursday (weather permitting) will total 7,800 cubic metres over about 17 days, Tepco said. For those of you not great at visualising volumes, that’s about three Olympic swimming pools.Is it dangerous?The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has approved the discharge, saying that the radiological impact on people and the environment would be “negligible”.The levels of tritium will be 1/40th of the legal level for discharges, Tepco insists, and has promised to upload hourly data on water quality. The scientific consensus has persuaded Justin that “as long as you are exposed to tritium in low doses, it doesn’t represent a threat to human health”.Greenpeace, however, has described the filtration process as flawed, and warned that an “immense” quantity of radioactive material will be dispersed into the sea over the coming decades. Concerns have also been raised by the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), the main intergovernmental organisation representing the region, which has been consulting with Japan over the release for the past two years and in January said it had “grave concerns” over the plans. In June, the PIF issued a statement drawing attention to international laws against dumping nuclear waste in the Pacific.Justin has come to the view that storing the water indefinitely is not a realistic option: “When does it end? What are you going to do with 2m tonnes, 3m tonnes? What about a leak? That area gets tsunamis, it gets quakes, it gets typhoons. What if something like that were to happen and lots of the tanks were damaged?”But much remains unknown. Justin asked a “very sensible” anti-nuclear expert if it would be safe for him to go swimming in the sea in Fukushima in September. The expert said yes, but that the problem is not swimming but “organically bound tritium – over the years, when it gets into seaweed, shellfish or fish and then consumed by humans over a long period. What does that do to human health? It’s difficult to say.”The falloutSurf’s up on Iwasawa beach in Naraha, Fukushima prefecture, Japan. Photograph: Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty ImagesSome of Japan’s neighbours are very unhappy. Hong Kong – the second-largest importer of food products from Japan after mainland China – said it will ban “aquatic products” from 10 Japanese prefectures. That includes the capital Tokyo, as well as Fukushima itself.Last month, Chinese customs administration threatened a blanket ban on all foodstuffs from the same 10 areas.Though South Korea’s government has given Japan its blessing, many residents are panicking, with reports that some people are stockpiling sea salt.Justin says there is an element of hypocrisy there. “Nuclear power plants, including those in South Korea, and China, pump diluted tritium into the sea all the time and nobody bats an eyelid.”China, he said, saw the controversy as a “very useful stick with which to beat Japan at the moment”.Japanese fishers are understandably worried about the damage to their reputation. So too are the marine-related tourist businesses which have started to reopen in Fukushima.Next month Justin is due in Fukushima again to cover an international surfing festival. Having visited the area on numerous occasions since 2011, including at least six visits to the wrecked power plant itself, he has no worries about his health on his latest trip.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

"Thousands more dead or dying shellfish have washed up on a beach on the same stretch of coast that saw a number of crustacean die-offs in autumn 2021 and last year.Visitors to Saltburn-by-the-Sea, a few miles south-east of the River Tees, were met by the sight of hundreds of thousands of dead mussels on the shoreline, as well as starfish, crabs and razor clams.Stuart Marshall, 58, who owns beach huts on the promenade, was mounting a clean-up on the sands. He said: “It’s devastating. There’s starfish dead, clams, oysters and crabs.” He questioned one possible official explanation that rough seas had killed the creatures, as he said the waters had recently been calm.Mystery of England’s crab and lobster die-offs deepens as experts find no clear causeRead moreHelen Whitworth, from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, was walking her border collie Drako on the beach. She said: “There’s all sorts of debris here. I’ve come down for a lovely walk with the dog and it’s such a shame to see all of this today.”There was confusion over a large deposit of black debris, which some said was sea coal, a type of coal that periodically washes up on the beach. Marshall, who has run the huts for almost seven years, said he did not believe the particles were coal, adding: “We do get bits of coal from time to time but not anything like this.”The Environment Agency said its experts concluded the wash-up was “a natural event” and “normal for this time of year”.A spokesperson said: “We can confirm the black substance washed up on the beach is coal deposit, which is not unusual for this stretch of coastline. This is likely to be in the intertidal system for a while given recent weather conditions, so may continue to happen in the coming weeks and months.“Creatures like starfish, razor clams and mussels occupy similar rocky habitat and are easily dislodged during storm events. And the physiology of juvenile flounder makes them vulnerable to being stranded on shallow gradient beaches such as Saltburn.“While we know people are concerned, the combination of recent heavy swell, spring tides and onshore winds means natural wash-ups will occur more often.”The mass die-off on the north-east coast in late 2021 prompted a series of investigations. In January this year, a panel of independent experts convened by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs concluded: “A novel pathogen is considered the most likely cause of mortality.”However, the panel was “unable to identify a clear and convincing single cause for the unusual crustacean mortality”. Some campaigners have feared that dredging for a new freeport on the Tees was linked to the die-off, but the Tees Valley mayor, Ben Houchen, has strongly disputed those claims.","{""shellfish die‑off"": 9, ""unknown pathogen"": 8, ""coal wash‑up pollution"": 7, ""storm impact on marine life"": 6, ""dredging impact speculation"": 5}"
"A US climate activist has died after he set himself on fire outside the US supreme court building in Washington.Wynn Bruce, from Boulder, Colorado, died on Saturday from his injuries, Washington’s Metropolitan Police Department said. Police said Bruce had set himself on fire at about 6.30pm on Friday, and was airlifted to hospital.A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan police told the Denver Post that investigators had not found a manifesto or note explaining Bruce’s motive.After the relentless rain, South Africa sounds the alarm on the climate crisisRead moreFriday was Earth Day, an annual global event to demonstrate support for environmental protection, and the supreme court has environmental cases on its docket.Bruce, 50, had recently edited a comment on his Facebook page, adding the date 22 April and a fire emoji. The comment was in response to a post about the global impact of climate change. Bruce had posted several times over the past year about the environment.On Sunday, Kritee Kanko, a Boulder-based climate scientist and Zen Buddhist priest, said Bruce was a friend and member of her Buddhist community, who had been planning the self-immolation for “at least one year”.“This act is not suicide. This is a deeply fearless act of compassion to bring attention to climate crisis,” Kanko said in a tweet.In a subsequent interview with the New York Times, Kanko said she could not be certain about Bruce’s intentions. She told the newspaper that “people are being driven to extreme amounts of climate grief and despair” and that “what I do not want to happen is that young people start thinking about self-immolation”.In April 2018 David Buckel, a prominent gay rights lawyer and environmental advocate, burned himself to death in New York.In a note, Buckel said: “Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result – my early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.”","{""climate change"": 9, ""fossil fuel pollution"": 8, ""environmental activism"": 7, ""climate grief"": 8, ""environmental justice"": 6}"

"Extreme and prolonged heat looks set to continue across the southern states of the US and Mexico through this week. This heatwave, which has already brought record temperatures across Texas through the past two weeks, will extend into states such as Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and Louisiana over the coming days.At least 50 million people have been placed under extreme heat advisories as temperatures are forecast to soar at least 5-10C above the climatological average, with daily maximum temperatures reaching 40-45C (104-113F). San Angelo airport in Texas has already recorded two consecutive days where the temperature hit 45.6C (114F), which surpasses its highest ever temperature by three degrees.This heat will continue to put stress on power grids across the southern states and Mexico. Texas in particular is uniquely vulnerable to power failures as it is the only state in the contiguous US that is disconnected from the national grid. As a result, the power grid operator for Texas has asked residents to voluntarily cut back on electricity due to anticipated record demand.In Mexico, demands on energy have already surpassed last year by 9% due to the heat. Blackouts have been reported in Cancún and Tulum, leaving many without air conditioning and fresh water. Several heat-related deaths have been reported by local media.Across Australia, a long band of rain will stretch more than 3,000km (1,800 miles) from the north-west through to the central region and into the south-east – including the outback. It is expected to bring anywhere between 10 and 100mm of rainfall across the entire region through this week. For the outback, this will easily surpass the winter climatological average for rainfall in just a few days.An area that is particularly at risk is around Alice Springs and Yulara, across southern and western parts of the Northern Territory, where the highest rainfall totals are expected of 50-100mm. This region of the Northern Territory is classed as a semi-arid or arid environment and on average receives only 250-300mm of rain every year. Alice Springs usually gets only 10.3mm of rainfall in June. As a result, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology has issued a flood watch warning through the entire week across four states.","{""Extreme heatwave"": 9, ""Power grid stress and blackouts"": 8, ""Heat-related deaths"": 7, ""Heavy rainfall and flood watch in Australia"": 8, ""Potential flooding in arid regions"": 8}"
"Scotland’s first minister and the mayor of London have urged Liz Truss to freeze energy prices immediately, as part of a package of emergency measures to address the cost of living crisis.Nicola Sturgeon and Sadiq Khan said the incoming UK prime minister had to increase funding for public services and urgently increase financial support for those in greatest need.Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, said: “We now need to work together, with urgency, to tackle the cost of living crisis, and save millions from hardship this winter.

U-turn on everything she believes in | Simon JenkinsRead moreBefore her election, Truss was widely criticised after telling Tory members Sturgeon was an “attention seeker” who should be ignored. Truss later indicated she was referring to the first minister’s calls for a second Scottish independence vote, and insisted she also wanted constructive relations with Edinburgh.Truss had also attacked Drakeford during the leadership campaign, calling him a “low energy” Jeremy Corbyn. Speaking on the BBC News channel, Drakeford brushed that off, saying such jibes “do not matter to families throughout Wales who live in fear of what this winter might bring to them”.Michelle O’Neill, the Sinn Féin leader at Stormont and Northern Ireland’s first minister in waiting, urged Truss to drop her plans to appease unionists by rewriting the Northern Ireland protocol – a move that threatens to wreck the Good Friday agreement that introduced power sharing.During the leadership campaign, Truss suggested she would rewrite the protocol to placate the Democratic Unionist party, which has refused to rejoin the executive while the protocol remains in its present form.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to First EditionFree daily newsletterOur morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it mattersEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

People voted for real change, and as first minister designate my priority is to restore the executive to deliver change.”In an opinion article for the newspaper CityAM, Khan asked Truss to take a far more collaborative approach with the regions and nations than her predecessors, setting out a detailed list of interventions to combat the economic crisis.“What we desperately need now is a government that is laser-focused on the economy, on investing in our public services and on supporting households through this difficult period, rather than one that is intent on stoking crude culture wars or playing our cities, towns and regions off against each other for political gain,” Khan said.“In the short term, the new prime minister must take whatever steps necessary to ease the pressures on household budgets to ensure people can keep their heads above water.”","{""energy price freeze"": 9, ""high energy bills"": 8, ""energy policy decisions"": 7}"
"Residents of Gunnedah on the New South Wales Liverpool Plains are appalled by the lack of preparation, warnings and response from authorities to Sunday’s Namoi River flood, as they brace for another deluge.Julie Shields, who lives on the north-west end of Bloomfield Street, started the Gunnedah Flood Information and Support Facebook group last December, after being disappointed in the response to Gunnedah’s November 2021 flood.On the Saturday before this week’s flood, she said: “I heard the SES was door-knocking, but we didn’t see them once.”“The only time I saw them was Saturday afternoon, they stopped up from our house in a ute.“They didn’t get out and ask, ‘Are you all right?’ – they just turned around and left.”‘Volunteer flexibly’: encouraging Australia’s millennial mud army to stick aroundRead moreShields lives with her mother, Kim Shields, who has been tracking local flood levels ever since she experienced her first flood, a month after moving to Gunnedah in 1984.Kim Shields knows that if the Namoi River levels reach 7.5 metres, their block will be flooded. This week’s flood peaked at 8.16 metres on Sunday morning.“We had our first flood in July 1984,” she said. “And from then I thought, well, I’ll write down what’s happened.”

The Shields criticised Water NSW for what they said was poor and inaccurate information on stored water levels, as well as keeping the upstream Keepit Dam at capacity even after the last flood.Guardian Australia searched Water NSW’s real-time data page on 20 September and found Keepit Dam’s capacity was showing as 101% on Saturday 17 September.“We probably need to look into Water NSW first; the handling of dams, why they need to keep them at 100%,” Julie Shields said.Julie and Kim Shields at the spot where Julie came on Friday to inspect the rising river level before putting an alert on her Facebook group. Photograph: Tom PleveyIn a statement, Water NSW said it “had reduced Keepit Dam to 96.6% of capacity in preparation for the larger-than-forecast rain event expected last Thursday, even with continued inflows from previous rainfall”, saying releases did not exceed 30GL/day while taking inflow of 45GL/day.According to Water NSW, it continued releases during this week’s flood, but its modelling shows 70% of the 102GL/day flow at Gunnedah came from “naturally occurring downstream tributaries”, and it said it is working the with Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) to monitor weather and project dam inflows.Julie Shields wanted to restart the conversation on Gunnedah getting a levee system, a plan that has been discussed since 2000. Downstream Wee-Waa, with its existing levee, was comparatively unaffected by the floods.“We only need half a levee just to hug the river,” she said, adding it could direct flood waters to uninhabited areas around the town’s sale yards.Erin and Michael Edmunds live on Talibah Street and were stranded for four days without running water during the November floods. Michael Edmunds, a full-time carer to two intellectually disabled sons, was livid the SES acting deputy zone command, Craig Ronan, told regional newspaper the Northern Daily Leader that no homes had been affected on Sunday.The Edmunds’ house had a small amount of water in a front room, but a house in town belonging to another family member was inundated.skip past newsletter promotionSign up to The Rural NetworkFree newsletterSubscribe to Calla Wahlquist's fortnightly update on Australian rural and regional affairsEnter your email address Enter your email address Sign upPrivacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

Photograph: Tom Plevey“Sunday morning, to see the story, ‘Gunnedah Comes Through Major Flood Unscathed’ – that was offensive,” Michael said.“I just saw red when I saw that article. What a joke. Like, they ignored us after the last flood, didn’t give us accurate information.”The Leader later edited the article after being contacted by the Edmunds, and issued an apology.Michael said the SES drove down their street and issued a warning to two neighbours, both in elevated houses, but didn’t warn his family or other residents.“They didn’t come here,” he said. “They drove down to the street here, turned around and went back to town.”‘Bigger and better than ever’: Australia’s rural shows bounce back after tough yearsRead moreErin said she called the SES hotline and was told they were not at risk.The Edmunds are still waiting on assistance promised to them for the November floods when the water in their house was “knee high”, but state efforts seem to be focused on Lismore, they say, and the $1,000 assistance payment only applies to floods after February 2022.NSW SES western zone commander, chief Supt David Monk, said the SES has been providing support to the Gunnedah community throughout the current flood, with volunteers door-knocking, sandbagging and responding to all requests for assistance.“Since the last storm season, NSW SES has implemented a number of improvements,” a spokesperson said.“The NSW SES has trained additional incident management personnel and has increased its surge capacity for call taking during emergencies.“The NSW SES is undertaking a transition to the new nationwide Australian warning system, bringing the agency in line with a nationally consistent framework for emergency warnings.”The Shields and Edmunds families are braced for further flooding, with the BoM predicting a 100% chance of rain on Wednesday.
